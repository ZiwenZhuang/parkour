## Repository Structure ##
* `legged_gym`: contains the isaacgym environment and config files.
    - `legged_gym/legged_gym/envs/{robot}/`: contains all the training config files for a specific robot
    - `legged_gym/legged_gym/envs/base/`: contains all the environment implementation.
    - `legged_gym/legged_gym/utils/terrain/`: contains the terrain generation code.
* `rsl_rl`: contains the network module and algorithm implementation. You can copy this folder directly to your robot.
    - `rsl_rl/rsl_rl/algorithms/`: contains the algorithm implementation.
    - `rsl_rl/rsl_rl/modules/`: contains the network module implementation.
 
## Training in Simulation ##
To install and run the code for training A1/Go2 in simulation, please clone this repository and follow the instructions in  [legged_gym/README.md](legged_gym/README.md).

## Hardware Deployment ##
To deploy the trained model on your unitree Go1 robot, please follow the instructions in [Deploy-Go1.md](onboard_codes/Deploy-Go1.md) for deploying on the Unittree Go1 robot.

To deploy the trained model on your unitree Go2 robot, please follow the instructions in [Deploy-Go2.md](onboard_codes/Deploy-Go2.md) for deploying on the Unittree Go2 robot.


## Trouble Shooting ##
If you cannot run the distillation part or all graphics computing goes to GPU 0 dispite you have multiple GPUs and have set the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES, please use docker to isolate each GPU.

NOTE: When playing the distilled policy in simulation, DO remember to set `ckpt_manipulator = None` when configuring the runner. Please refer to [#82](https://github.com/ZiwenZhuang/parkour/issues/82) for more detail.

## To Do ##
- [x] Go1 training configuration (does not guarantee the same performance as the paper)
- [ ] A1 deployment code
- [x] Go1 deployment code
- [x] Go2 training configuration example (does not guarantee the same performance as the paper)
- [x] Go2 deployment code example
